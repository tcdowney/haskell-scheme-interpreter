### Solutions for [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)

I am (slowly) working through this book and teaching myself Haskell along the way (using [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)).

I intend on using this repository to manage my solutions to the exercises in the book and hopefully provide some noob-level solutions for other imperative programmers who are trying out Haskell.
